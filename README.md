webstorm-bluloco-scheme
=======================

The bluloco color scheme for Jetbrains' Webstorm IDE 11 (and other Jetbrains IDEs) + Sublime Text / TextMate.
There is a light and dark variant included.

This scheme / theme supports all built-in languages in Webstorm 11:

```
JavaScript, CoffeeScript, CSS, Cucumber, Dart EJS, HAML Handlebars/Mustache,
HTML, Jade, JSON, JSP, LESS, RegExp,
SASS/SCSS, Stylus, TypeScript, XML, XPath, YAML
```

This color scheme is optimized for the languages above, but it's still possible to use it in all other products of Jetbrains, such as `Intelij IDEA, PhpStorm, RubyMine, PyCharm, etc.`

Though it could be possible, that you have to make fine adjustments for the unsupported languages to let it look flawless.

## Screenshots:

A few samples of the look and feel.
The used font here is Adobe's beautiful `SourceCodePro Medium`.

## Installation

You can install the theme by simply importing the `Bluloco.jar` file directly in Webstorm, via `File > Import Settings`.

## Manual Install

1.  Put the `Bluloco.icl` or `Bluloco-Light.icls` file in the config folder of your Webstorm installation.

    Standard paths are the following ones:

    _Linux_:  `~/.Webstorm10/config/colors/`

    _Mac_:    `~/Libraries/Preferences/.Webstorm10/config/colors/`

    _Windows_: `%USERPROFILE%/.Webstorm10/config/colors`

2. Restart the IDE
3. Select the new `Bluloco` Theme in `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts`.


## Sublime Text / TextMate
I recently added support for the Sublime Text / Textmate editor.
Herefore, just take the `Bluloco.tmTheme` file, and insert it in your User packages folder, that's it.
