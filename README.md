I will leave the files in this repository. If you like them and want to help me, feel free to make a pull requrest or fork :)

The bluloco color scheme for Jetbrains' Webstorm IDE (and other Jetbrains IDEs)
There is theme includes several variants: dark, light, dim, material and night.

## Installation

You can install the theme by simply importing the `Bluloco.jar` file directly in Webstorm, via `File > Import Settings`.
This will install all variants.
