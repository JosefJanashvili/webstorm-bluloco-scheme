webstorm-bluloco-scheme
=======================

The bluloco color scheme for Jetbrains' Webstorm IDE 9 (and other Jetbrains IDEs)

This scheme / theme supports all built-in languages in Webstorm 9:

```
JavaScript, CoffeeScript, CSS, Cucumber, Dart EJS, HAML Handlebars/Mustache, 
HTML, Jade, JSON, JSP, LESS, RegExp, 
ASS/SCSS, Stylus, TypeScript, XML, XPath, YAML
```

This color scheme is optimized for the languages above, but it's still possible to use it in all other products of Jetbrains, such as `Intelij IDEA, PhpStorm, RubyMine, PyCharm, etc.`

Though it could be possible, that you have to make fine adjustments for the unsupported languages to let it look flawless.
