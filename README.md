webstorm-bluloco-scheme
=======================

The bluloco color scheme for Jetbrains' Webstorm IDE 9 (and other Jetbrains IDEs)

This scheme / theme supports all built-in languages in Webstorm 9:

```
JavaScript, CoffeeScript, CSS, Cucumber, Dart EJS, HAML Handlebars/Mustache, 
HTML, Jade, JSON, JSP, LESS, RegExp, 
ASS/SCSS, Stylus, TypeScript, XML, XPath, YAML
```

This color scheme is optimized for the languages above, but it's still possible to use it in all other products of Jetbrains, such as `Intelij IDEA, PhpStorm, RubyMine, PyCharm, etc.`

Though it could be possible, that you have to make fine adjustments for the unsupported languages to let it look flawless.

## Screenshots:

A few samples of the look and feel.
The used font here is Adobe's beautiful `SourceCodePro Medium`.

## Installation

It is really easy to install. 

1.  Put the `Bluloco.icl` file in the config folder of your Webstorm installation.
    Standard paths are:

    _Linux_:  `~/.Webstorm9/config/colors/`
    
    _Mac_:    `~/Libraries/Preferences/.Webstorm9/config/colors/`
    
    _Windows_ path: `%USERPROFILE%/.Webstorm9/config/colors`

2. Restart the IDE
3. Select the new `Bluloco` Theme in `Preferences | Editor | Colors & Fonts`.

## Sublime Text
I recently added support for the Sublime Text / Textmate editor.
Herefore, just take the `Bluloco.tmTheme` file, and insert it in your User packages folder.
